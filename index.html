        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Aastha Gulati. I am currently a First year pre-med Psychology major at University of California Riverside. I am from  Evergreen San Jose which is in the Bay Area in California. I was born in India and lived in Singapore before moving to Santa Clara and from there San Jose. 
In my free time I like to read and paint. I have been painting since I was a little kid and have taken classes professionally.  painting is something that allows me to express myself in a way that no other form of creative expression can.  and it's not just painting it's any form of Art that requires traditional mediums such as again paint pencil color pencils anything put to paper.  I just love to create.  this translates over into digital marketing.  I am currently the  I currently work  in digital marketing at Sierra Grates.  and I love it there.  it's honestly my father's company and I have a great time being able to work with him and makes me feel closer to him.  right now all he really focuses on is his company so this is really a great way for me to connect to him since there is not many other things that we have in common right now.  I love my father but we rarely talk.  I miss him.  it's been really hard moving to Riverside because  because before moving here I was very hyper dependent on my parents.  I am able to take care of myself it's just a part of me doesn't really want to which is leading to me staying out all night not sleeping doing things that my parents would not be proud of and getting sick.  I feel this is my way of proving to myself that I need my parents to survive because I feel guilty for knowing that I can survive without them.  I really miss my parents and I cannot wait to see them again.  I also don't understand why I have to write 500 words for a CS project but I guess here we are.  I don't know if anyone's going to read this so I'm just going to trauma dump and you got to deal with it.  I hope you enjoy.  I am at around 300 words and I don't know what else to write so I'm just going to keep talking into the microphone and hope that this keeps going and I can just copy paste it into the bio because I really think it's stupid that I have to write this much for a CS project that I didn't even know was due which yes it's my fault I should have checked the due date and I'm pretty sure it's past you right now but it's okay because cs8 is saying something else as the due date cs8 is saying it's due on the 11th even though canvas says it's due like 10 minutes ago okay I need like eight more words. Thank you.
